Installaion
===========
Follow the instructions outlined here:
https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr/wiki/Akvo-RSR-developer-guide (up to "Build your local development environment")

Preconditions
=============
Some of the tests require accounts to be set up with appropriate permissions (e.g. a test administration account to enable the creation of projects) and a number of configuration files to be set up. The following templates are provided to assist:

/features/site_under_test.py.template
/features/donations/auth.py.template

Create copies of these files by navigating to the directories in which they are located and executing the following commands:

>> cp site_under_test.py.template site_under_test.py
>> cd donations
>> cp auth.py.template auth.py

Then edit the copies (site_under_test.py and auth.py) to contain the relevant passwords, accounts and configurations. (These files are listed in the .gitignore file to avoid passwords accidently being checked in)

Using Lettuce
=============
1) Navigate to the directory that contains the "features" subdirectory (e.g. currently the root directory in the RSR code base)

2) Enter one of the two options on the command line:

>> lettuce
to run the full suite of available tests

or

>> lettuce features/<location of feature file you wish to run>

e.g.

>> lettuce smoke_tests/server_tests.feature

which will run only the tests contained in the server_tests.feature file

Piping Output to a Logfile
==========================
Use '>' to create/overwrite a file or '>>' to append to an existing file

For example
>> lettuce --verbosity=2 donations/ > log.txt

This command runs lettuce and writes the results to the log file called "log.txt". The verbosity level dictates the amount of detail contained in the output of the test run.

It can be useful to include the date and time the tests were started in title of the logfile. This can be done using output from the "date" command. The following command:

>> lettuce --verbosity=2 donations/ > logfile_`date +"%d.%m.%Y_%Hh%Mm%Ss"`.txt

Produces a log file in the directory in which the command was run with a name such as: "logfile_27.03.2013_11h29m07s.txt"

Using PayPal Sandbox test accounts
==================================
When running tests that utilise the PayPal sandbox it is necessary to set environment variable that holds the business email address set up on the PayPal test account on the server being targetted for testing. This can only be done by someone who has been given permission to access and edit the file on the server.
