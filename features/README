Using Lettuce
=============
1) Navigate to the directory that contains the "features" subdirectory (e.g. currently the root directory in the RSR code base)

2) Enter one of the two options on the command line:

>> lettuce
to run the full suite of available tests

or

>> lettuce features/<location of feature file you wish to run>

e.g.

>> lettuce smoke_tests/server_tests.feature

which will run only the tests contained in the server_tests.feature file
