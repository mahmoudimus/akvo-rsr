# Generated API documentation

The list below has been generated by an XSLT transform applied to the schema output of the API (the schema has been enhanced with things like max length of text fields). 

This way we can get a nicely formatted, generated output that's based on the actual current API. There's nothing that precludes post editing by hand and seems to me a much better way of creating the source for the documentation than to do it all by hand. 

This is just a rough proof of concept and there's stuff missing. For example many of the help texts are generic, but can be customized by adding help text to the model fields.
