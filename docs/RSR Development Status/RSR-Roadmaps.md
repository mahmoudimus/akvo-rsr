We maintain a Software Devliery Roadmap for RSR to provide direction for the Team and to ensure we can incorporate planning and requests from all of our partners and our working environment to implement effect6ive prioritisation.

We publish a simplified version of the Roadmap on the Akvo.org website. (Link to be added).

We also have a slightly more detailed version of the Roadmap within Trello: https://trello.com/b/2JqQoPOp/akvo-rsr-development-roadmap
