We have a daily RSR Standup for Coding Developers on the RSR Team.
We also have a weekly Meeting for the Entire RSR Team.

Standups should be used to improve communication within the team, especially as we are a dislocated team.
The purpose of Standups is:

- Feedback on Work being undertaken (work completed should be visible via Pull Requests and Code Checks)
- Raise any issues with current work or workload.
- Communicate about any shared discussions or decisions that have been made.
- Troubleshoot with Team about specific Code/Tech problems.
- Highlight any upcoming changes in personal circumstances (Absences, Sickness, Holidays etc.)
- Raise any deadline or date that may not be attained

General Standup Guidelines:

- Attend only if you have been or are about to work within the RSR Codebase
- Keep Work status update to 5 minutes
- Mention all RSR issues assigned to you even if just to confirm work has not started

Weekly Meetings should be used to share information about the wider Akvo Environment and discuss upcoming plans.
The purpose of the Weekly Meeting is:

- Share Akvo related news
- Raise any challenges or issues being faced by the team
- Relay and receive information from other Dev Teams
- Discuss and confirm on short and medium term Roadmaps
- Highlight upcoming challenges

General Weekly Meeting Guidelines:

- Always attend
- Invite other Dev Members if you feel they should be included
- Prepare any questions or info you want to hear about
- Try to listen (don't just attend on mute and continue working)
