# Akvo Really Simple Reporting (Akvo RSR)

Akvo RSR is part of the Akvo Platform. The Akvo Platform is used on Akvo.org to combat poverty through small-scale water and sanitation projects. We believe that Akvo RSR can be used in many other development aid scenarios, in areas such as education, health care, agriculture, etc.
